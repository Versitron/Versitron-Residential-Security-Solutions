## Industrial PoE Switches for Security Camera Installations

**Power and data delivery over a single cable — ideal for IP-camera surveillance.**

- Supplies both data + power to IP cameras via PoE, eliminating separate power wiring. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Built ruggedly to withstand harsh environments: temperature extremes, vibration, surges — suitable for outdoor or industrial surveillance. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Simplifies installation and reduces cabling complexity — important for large-scale or multi-site camera deployments. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## Ethernet Switches for Video Security Surveillance

**Switches optimized for video traffic, high throughput, and reliability in security networks.**

- Enables stable, low-latency video streaming over Ethernet + fiber networks, ideal for IP cameras and NVR connectivity. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Supports Power over Ethernet (PoE / PoE+) to power cameras, access control, and other devices without separate power supplies. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Allows scalable expansion — as camera count grows, network can be expanded without major rewiring or power changes. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Managed PoE+ Switches for Video Security Systems

**Advanced management and power delivery for critical, high-availability surveillance networks.**

- Managed switches offer VLANs, QoS, traffic prioritization — important when mixing data, video, and control traffic. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- PoE+ ensures enough power for more demanding devices (e.g. high-power PTZ cameras, IR illuminators, smart cameras). :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- Industrial-grade reliability: wide temperature range, shock/surge protection, redundant power inputs — essential for 24/7 operations. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}
